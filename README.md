Solves Sudoku Puzzles

New Edit: I wrote this in high school so it's really REALLY bad. I'm too ashamed to look at it. 
I remember clocking it to find out that it ran at O(10^n) where n was the empty spaces of the puzzle. Just shameful. 

I also recall that some heuristics allowed for 14-16 empty spaces to be solved in about 1 second, and afterwards being O(10^n) or less.

My first "big" Java program that was "useful."
